# Search Algorithms in C

Welcome to the Search Algorithms project in C!

## About

This project delves into the fascinating world of search algorithms implemented in the C programming language. From the basic yet versatile linear search to the more sophisticated binary search, we explore the intricacies of these algorithms and their practical applications.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging with this project, you'll achieve a deeper understanding of:

- What search algorithms are and how they work.
- The differences between linear and binary search.
- When to use each search algorithm based on your specific needs.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the source code and experiment with different test cases in the provided main.c file. Compile the code using your preferred C compiler, and observe the behavior of the search algorithms in action.

## Contributions

Contributions and feedback are always welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or spot any issues, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
